Sir as you know i am getting 1/3rd (9000) of my salary since lock down. I am thankful to you that you support me at that crucial time i am being  able to paid my loan EMI's on time.
I also understood the situation as i did not want to be an extra burden on company because i was not known much about work.
But in last 2-3 months Suresh sir trained me on almost every technical support which i have to given to team.
Now i am working properly with Suresh sir and giving my support to team. You can asked to Suresh sir about my work and performance.
I just want to get my full actual salary (27000,In hand + PF) as now i am working regularly and its being getting tough to survive in 9000 for me now.
If you and team want to give me some extra work i am ready for that but i request you to pay me my full salary (27000,In  hand + PF). 
I want your support one more time sir and i hope you undertand.
